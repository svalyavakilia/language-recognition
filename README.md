# Language recognition
This application allows you to write or paste in some text and check, in what language it has been written!

Only languages added to the project could be recognized correctly.
To add a new language, you should create a new directory in _resources/languages/training_,
which has a name of the language, and add some (or one, but big enough) **.txt** file(s) with some
text written in this language to train the algorithm.
You should also do the same in _resources/languages/testing_ to check, if algorithms has been
trained successfully.
